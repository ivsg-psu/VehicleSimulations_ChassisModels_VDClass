function wheel_velocity = fcn_VD_stWheelVelocity(U,V,r,vehicle)
%% fcn_VD_stWheelVelocity
%   This function computes velocities for front and rear wheels.
%   It uses single-track/bicycle vehicle model.
%
%   Coordinate System: ISO
%
% FORMAT:
%
%   wheel_velocity = fcn_VD_stWheelVelocity(U,V,r,vehicle)
%
% INPUTS:
%
%   U: Longitudinal velocity [m/s]
%   V: Lateral velocity [m/s]
%   r: Yaw rate [rad/s]
%   vehicle: MATLAB structure containing vehicle properties
%
% OUTPUTS:
%
%   wheel_velocity: A 2x2 vector of wheel velocities [m/s]
%   First column is along vehicle (X-Direction) and second column is 
%   perpendicular to vehicle (Y-Direction) [Front; Rear]
