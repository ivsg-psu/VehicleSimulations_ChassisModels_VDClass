%% Define vehicle properties
% Define a MATLAB structure that specifies the physical values for a vehicle.
% For convenience, we ask that you call this stucture 'vehicle'.
vehicle.m   = 1600; % mass (kg)
vehicle.Izz = 2500; % mass moment of inertia (kg m^2)
vehicle.Iw  = 1.2; % mass moment of inertia of a wheel (kg m^2)
vehicle.Re  = 0.32; % effective radius of a wheel (m)
vehicle.a   = 1.3; % length from front axle to CG (m)
vehicle.L   = 2.6; % wheelbase (m)
vehicle.b   = 1.3; % length from rear axle to CG (m)
vehicle.d   = 1.5; % track width (m)
vehicle.h_cg = 0.42; % height of the cg (m)
vehicle.Ca  = [95000; 95000; 110000; 110000]; % wheel cornering stiffnesses
vehicle.Cx  = [65000; 65000; 65000; 65000]; % longitudinal stiffnesses

%% Define inputs to the vehicle model
U = 24.59; % longitudinal velocity [m/s]
V = 0.0; % lateral velocity [m/s]
r = 0.5; % yaw rate [rad/s]
steering_amplitude = 2*pi/180; % front steering angle [rad]
Period = 3; % Units are seconds. A typical lane change is about 3 to 4 seconds based on experimental highway measurements

% Define items used to determine how long to run sim
TotalTime = 5; % This is how long the simulation will run.
deltaT = 0.01;
N_timeSteps = floor(TotalTime/deltaT)+1; % This is the number of time steps we should have
